Notes on problems found in the original programs:

- Table names cannot be all uppercase. Presumably only keywords can.
- IF statements have to have a semicolon after the close bracket, even though other close brackets don't.
- IF statement execution blocks can be empty!
- Hardware API calls cannot start with a lowercase (presumably to increase distinction between hardware functions and SNL variables/data).
- Equivalence is checked with a single equals (since assignment is :=)
